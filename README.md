# Grepolis-Angular

School project. 

A small webapp which displays data from grepolis. The crontabs read the Grepolis API, which are plain text files, process them and insert them into a database.
The back-end C# API turns that database into a REST API which we uploaded to azure. Finally we have an Angular app on the front-end to display all of our data.

The database is no longer in use so this project is for code-viewing purposes only.
